Please create a page management interface in PHP and the javascript framework of your choice. Here are the requirements:

- The interface should display a list of pages.
- Each of these pages should be selectable.
- When selecting a page, its properties should be shown and editable (Title, Hidden from navigation?, etc)
- You should be able to drag a page to re-order it.
- There are 2 types of pages: Regular and Blog.
- You should be able to add a regular page or blog page.
- You should be able to delete a page.

Optional Bonus Points:
- The pages should be in a hierarchical (tree) format.
- You should be able to drag a page under another page to set it as a child.

Areas to focus on:
- Please focus on making smart UI decisions.
- Don't worry too much about the visual design, although basic attention to design is good.
- Please provide a technically well thought out solution with well designed, clean code.
